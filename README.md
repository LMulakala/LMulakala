# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm Lahari Mulakala, a high school student passionate about cybersecurity and computer science.
Over the past three years, I've immersed myself in computer science coding using Java, and now eager to explore Python, C#, C++, and beyond. 
However, I only recently took interest in cybersecurity, so I hope to use my experience with computer science to learn cybersecurity, all the while continuing to develop my computer science skills.
Through this GitHub profile, I aim to document my progress, sharing projects that reflect my evolving expertise in software development and beyond. 

## Projects

My GitHub account will include projects that mainly focus on my journey of learning cybersecurity through computer science. 
In my projects you will notice that I use Java to make cybersecurity tools, as it is my way of learning how the tool functions and important 
In my GitHub profile I have completed and in progress projects (more coming soon):

1. **Java Networking - PS**: a website that includes information about computer networking, Java networking, and a port scanner that I developed
   - https://laharimulakala039.wixsite.com/java-networking---ps

Feel free to explore this project and suggest any changes you think I can make to improve. Your feedback is highly appreciated!

## Computer Science Labs

In my years of being in High School I have created a multitude of "labs" in my computer science class.
In my GitHub I included _some_ of the most recent labs I have created in my class (will be added soon).
