# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Lahari Mulakala, a High School student passionate about learning cybersecurity and computer science. 
I have been learning computer science for about 3 years now, but only recently took intrest in cybersecurity. 
I hope to use my experience with computer science to learn cybersecurity, all the while continuing to develop my computer science skills.
I currently only know Java, but I hope to learn Python, C#, C++, and other languages to broaden my knowledge.
Here you'll find a collection of projects reflecting my journey in the world of software development and beyond.

## Projects

My GitHub account will include projects that mainly focus on my journey of learning cybersecurity through computer science. 
In my projects you will notice that I use Java to make cybersecurity tools, as it is my way of learning how the tool functions and important 
Here's some projects I have completed/working on:
